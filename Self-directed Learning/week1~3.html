    <b>AI, return-to-office, the summer of strikes and more: both labourers and employers found themselves working through a rollercoaster of changes this year.</b>
    <br><br>
    <p>The work world has been a moving target for a while now. In 2023, some of the unresolved issues of the past three years settled, especially around the return to office. Yet evolving technology and a surge in organised labour meant plenty of new themes cropped up. They combined for a year of work unlike any other. </p>
    <br><br>
    <b>AI began its inevitable rise </b>
    <br><br>
    <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63861322">The launch of ChatGPT on 30 November</a>
    <br><br>
    <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63861322">2022</a> set the stage for a tidal wave of workplace changes in 2023. The impact of artificial intelligence on the labour force ­– and the future of work as we know it – was perhaps the most high profile topic of the year. And for good reason.</p>
    <p>Generative AI quickly came to infiltrate nearly every element of work, both for employers and workers. Recruiters began to see <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230419-chatgpt-how-generative-ai-could-change-hiring-as-we-know-it">job applicants sending in materials written with ChatGPT</a>; workers began to integrate the technology into their daily jobs – depending on it to the point that they found ways to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231017-the-employees-secretly-using-ai-at-work">secretly access the tools if they were banned.</a></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>One of the most <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230418-ai-anxiety-artificial-intelligence-replace-jobs">ubiquitous worries</a> – even <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230712-ai-can-threaten-your-personal-identity-but-it-doesnt-have-to">existential concerns</a> – among workers was whether AI would come for their jobs, especially as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65102150">2023 data from firms including Goldman Sachs</a> and McKinsey and Company indicated replacement-by-robot may be imminent for many people.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>The answer is still murky. Some experts say the first jobs on the generative AI chopping block may be entry-level roles, such as data entry or customer service. Yet emerging advances are also beginning to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231128-ai-powered-digital-colleagues-are-here-some-safe-jobs-could-be-vulnerable">threaten higher-skilled knowledge work jobs</a>, such as graphic designers or music producers, that workers mostly believed were "safe" for now.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>It's not quite time to panic, though. First, many experts say there are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230507-the-jobs-ai-wont-take-yet">jobs that will be difficult to automate outright</a> – especially roles that require a human touch, sophisticated interpersonal relationships or out-of-the-box thinking.</p>
