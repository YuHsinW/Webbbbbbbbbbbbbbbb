    <h1>Why have the wildfires in S Korea been so devastating?</h1>
    <p>Strong winds, dense forest and unusually dry weather - that's the deadly combination that experts say is fuelling the largest wildfires in South Korea's history.</p>
    <p>The inferno in the south-east has burned through 35,810 hectares (88,500 acres) as of Thursday - that's about half the size of New York City - killing 27 people so far and displacing tens of thousands.</p>
    <p>Authorities believe the wildfires started by accident from human activity, but the main drivers of the devastation are dry land, and strong gusts sweeping over inland regions.</p>
    <p>The high concentration of pine forest in North Gyeongsang province, where the fires are burning, is also "oiling" the blaze, said a forest disaster expert.</p>
    <h2>Vulnerable pine forests</h2>
    <p>"Pine trees contain resin, which acts like oil, intensifying fires when ignited. This resin causes wildfires to burn faster, stronger, and longer," said Lee Byung-doo from the National Institute of Forest Science in Seoul.</p>

    <p>Andong, one of the worst-hit cities, is known for its tranquil pine forests.</p>
    <p>While they provide shelter and food for local wildlife and sometimes help break the wind, pine trees "become problematic during wildfires", Mr Lee told the BBC.

        "Because forests [in South Korea] contain large numbers of pine trees, the areas are particularly vulnerable when fires break out," he said.</p>
